Or it might be more accurate to say that everyone interested in poetry is “not talking” about poetic difficulty, a “not talking” that acknowledges that this is a difficult, divisive topic, our differences of language, history, metaphysics, and identity. Glissant and Celan give us a sense of why this might be, that poetic difficulty is not just due to verbal intricacy, hypertrophied allusiveness, or the poetic equivalents of quantum physics; poetic difficulty opens onto dark, historical depths. Poetic difficulty is almost the inverse of the aesthetic judgment “interesting” about which Sianne Ngai has written so compellingly.[14] Yet for many critics unsympathetic to late modernism, poetic difficulty is an annoying insect. Reviewers react with hostility and disgust to what they perceive, in Charles Bernstein’s words, as an “attack of the difficult poems.”[15] Poetic difficulty deserves critical insecticide. Poetic difficulty is a sign that a poem lacks the good manners of lyrics which make the short visits and limited demands that Marianne Moore’s imaginary “father” recommended.[16] For poets in the late modernist tradition, however, poetic difficulty is a stigma worn with pride... Joke? It isn’t easy being a programmer. They code all day, debug all night and go through thousands of code lines trying to clear up all possible messes before going live with their code. Sometimes, it takes a fellow programmer to understand the hardships of another programmer. The same can be said of their jokes...A programmer is walking along a beach and finds a lamp.  He rubs the lamp, and a genie appears.  “I am the most powerful genie in the world.  I can grant you any wish, but only one wish.” The programmer pulls out a map, points to it and says, “I’d want peace in the Middle East.” The genie responds, “Gee, I don’t know.  Those people have been fighting for millennia.  I can do just about anything, but this is likely beyond my limits.” The programmer then says, “Well, I am a programmer, and my programs have lots of users.  Please make all my users satisfied with my software and let them ask for sensible changes. At which point the genie responds, “Um, let me see that map again.”
